- Logging
- Support for POST requests
- Support for SSL sockets
- Support for some kind of scripting language
  - FCGI support?
  - Use libtcc?
- VirtualHost
- Ditch configuration and try to pick sane defaults
- Create epoll() implementation for FreeBSD (based on kqueue) or see if
  libevent/libev are worth trying
- Status screen (uptime, number of connections, keep-alive connections,
  memory usage, etc)
- shave a pointer from strbuf_t (less fragmentation!)
- Memory pool for coroutines
  - Or some other stackless coroutine thing, like Simon Tatham's?
- dup() vs openat()
- Investigate TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT and TCP_QUICKACK flags
- Win the C10M challenge
- Use list.h more
  - Template engine
  - Coroutine?
  - Hash table?
- Use RCU (liburcu?) instead of rwlocks
- Postprocess compiled template so that IF and ITER chunks points
  directly to the actual END chunks
- Tune SQLite usage for Freegeoip sample app:
  - Open one connection per thread, set MULTITHREADED mode
  - Disable locking, journal
  - Set MMAP sizes to database size

     - or -
 
  - Write a custom on-disk trie to lookup IP addresses
- Refactor the whole coroutine suspend/resume mess in lwan-thread.c, as it
  isn't very clear what happens whenever a coroutine yields a 0. This is
  important since now most error recovery strategies uses yield 0 as a
  mechanism to shutdown the coroutine immediately.
