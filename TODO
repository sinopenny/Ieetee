- Logging
- Correct parsing of URL (query string, fragment, etc)
- Support for POST requests
- Support for SSL sockets
- Support for some kind of scripting language
  - FCGI support?
  - Use libtcc?
- VirtualHost
- Ditch configuration and try to pick sane defaults
- Optimize trie to use less memory
- Create epoll() implementation for FreeBSD (based on kqueue) or see if
  libevent/libev are worth trying
- Do not use libc's ucontext stuff; they make calls to rt_setsigprocmask()
  while there's no need for that in lwan's case
- Status screen (uptime, number of connections, keep-alive connections,
  memory usage, etc)
