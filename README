Lwan is a toy web server. So plastic-y that it can't even serve files, only
a "Hello, world!" page.  OK, it can serve files now -- but don't count on
it, it will most probably just mess things up.

It is meant to be only an exercise in writing a server using BSD sockets and
other auxilliary APIs, like epoll. It is not meant to serve things on the
Internet, as it isn't resilient enough.

This can yield around 390000+ requests/s on a dual-core Core i7 processor. 
Not too shabby for something written in some days on my spare time.  I'm
open to suggestions that can improve performance; better yet if you can fork
it and actually make it happen.
