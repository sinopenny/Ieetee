Lwan is a toy web server. So plastic-y that it can't even serve files, only
a "Hello, world!" page.

It is meant to be only an exercise in writing a server using BSD sockets and
other auxilliary APIs, like epoll. It is not meant to serve things on the
Internet, as it isn't resilient enough.

This can yield up to 35000 requests/s on a dual-core Core i7 processor. Not
much, but for something written in just over a day, it's not as bad as it
sounds.  I'm open to suggestions that can improve performance; better yet if
you can fork it and actually make it happen.
